The Fake News Detector is a simple Java-based application that analyzes news articles to determine whether they may contain misleading or fake information. It works by scanning the text for specific keywords commonly associated with fake news.

Features:
Keyword-Based Detection: The program checks for the presence of predefined words often found in fake news (e.g., "shocking," "conspiracy," "hidden truth").
User Input: The user enters a news article, and the system evaluates it.
Instant Feedback: The program provides immediate feedback on whether the article is likely fake or legitimate.

How It Works:
The user inputs a news article.
The system converts the text to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
It scans the text for fake news keywords.
If any keyword is found, it flags the article as potentially fake.
The result is displayed to the user.

Future Enhancements:
Machine Learning Integration: Implement AI models trained on real-world datasets for better accuracy.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use NLP techniques to analyze sentence structure and context.
Fact-Checking API Integration: Cross-check articles with fact-checking databases like PolitiFact or Snopes.

1. Sentiment Analysis
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of the news article.
Fake news often uses strong emotional language (e.g., fear, anger, excitement).
We can integrate Apache OpenNLP or Stanford NLP for this.

2. Web Scraping & Fact-Checking API
Cross-check the news article with trusted fact-checking websites like PolitiFact, Snopes, or FactCheck.org.
Use Jsoup or Apache HttpClient for web scraping.
API integration to compare news content with verified sources.

3. Machine Learning (ML) Model Integration
Train a model using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Naïve Bayes for classification.
Use TensorFlow, Weka, or Scikit-learn (via Jython) to analyze patterns in fake and real news.
Dataset: Use Kaggle’s Fake News Dataset for training.

4. URL & Source Verification
Verify if the domain of the news source is reputable.
Check if the URL appears in a fake news database.

5. User Report System
Allow users to flag suspected fake news.
Create a database to store flagged articles for further analysis.
